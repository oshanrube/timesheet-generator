* Big thanks goes to these projects for making this project in such a short time

/* TODO */
* add js effects for notices, controllers etc

/* DONE */
* add a custom task
* add a EXPORT filter
	projects, tasks, within FROM - TO

/* KNOWN BUGS */
* Timezone error when hosted in a different timezone - there is another brach for this fix but its still in progress
* custom tasks will need more detailed version to saved correctly into the db - this will be fixed when the timestaps are converted to ints when we merge the utc fix

/* Fixed */
* split error in bootstrap date picker
